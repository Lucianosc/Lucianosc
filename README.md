Hi there! I'm a frontend developer specializing in building intuitive and responsive user interfaces using React and Next JS. With a strong background in web development and a passion for blockchain technology, I have recently started to work and study about web3 and smart contract integration in web applications. 

I have a particular interest in DEFI and NFTs, and have been following the latest developments in these exciting areas of the blockchain ecosystem. I believe in writing clean and maintainable code, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open source projects or exploring the outdoors.

Feel free to check out my portfolio and GitHub repos to see some of my past projects. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges, so don't hesitate to reach out!
